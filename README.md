# My Summer Training Program 2024 in Lukasiewicz IMiF Crakow

My job was to develop stand for automatic spectography of plasma. I implemented spetrometer handling and data transmission server in C. In python I created server client, handling for power supply, DAQ and osciloscop.  

Osciloscop drives and library needed Windows XP to work, so data was sent via local server to recieve and process it during runtime.

### Some results:
